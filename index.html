	My name is Carina Flach and I am an exchange student from Germany. Currently I am spending my semester aboard at the San Diego State University. I started studying business administration at the University of Mannheim in August 2016 and I will finish my bachelor’s degree next year. I have done various internships in different areas, such as the human resource department. In this internship I realized that I could not imagine myself working in HR. However, I would still like to have a job where I interact a lot with different people. I am currently working as a working student (this means that I work 10 hours per week next to my study) in the logistics department in a German automotive company. After working in this department, I realized how much I like to coordinate things and stay in contact with suppliers and customers. Nevertheless, I do not want to stay in this industry and this is why I came up with the idea of trying something else. I have chosen to take a tourism and hospitality management course at the San Diego State University because I am very interested in this growing business. I have worked in restaurants before and realized how much I enjoy getting in touch with different customers. I would like to combine the tourism and the food industry by opening my own hotel. My dream career would be to have a hotel chain which offers hotels all around the world in tourist places. Due to the fact that I prefer staying in city center hotels and resorts I would offer these two types of hotels. City center hotels would be for business and leisure travels who want to experience an exquisite and luxury overnight stay. The resorts are for families or couples who want to enjoy their time in the hotel´s room, the beache or the lounges. If you want to know some more about my future career please go to professionals passion. 
	I believe that my enthusiastic nature will help me in my future career. I am an optimistic person and I will always find a way if I want something. Besides, my large Network in all kind of industries will help me as well. Please go to the Meaningful Experiences section for further detail. 
	I have chosen to write a guest speaker reflection about Colleen Anderson because her career is very impressive, and she became my idol. She is a woman who managed to move up the ranks while having a family. I know that is going to be hard for me as a woman to compete with all the men in the tourism industry, but I will do the best I can. I was also impressed by the guest speaker Josh Green because he had already all kind of jobs in a restaurant. I think it is very important to experience the different positions in a restaurant by yourself in order to become an effective Restaurant Manager. If you want to learn more about these two guest speakers, please go to coursework highlights.
